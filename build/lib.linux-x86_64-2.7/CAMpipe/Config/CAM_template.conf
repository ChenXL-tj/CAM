### Description of parameters in [General]
# [required]inputa: (ABSOLUTE path)main input file of CAM, accept fastq (raw MNase-seq data), sam/bam (bowtie1/2 alignment output) and bed (alignment output transformed from sam, 6 column, 5th column is bowtie map quality and 6th column is strand ) format, format is decided by the extension of input file(.fastq, .sam or .bed)
#           inputb: (ABSOLUTE path)This pararmeter is for the 2nd part of paired-end fastq files. Required only if input file is fastq file and sequencing type is paired-end sequencing, only accept raw fastq input. The extension should be .fastq. Note that if your data in paired end. you should also specify "seqtype"(below) as PE 
# [required]seqtype: sequencing type of your sample, choose from SE(single end, default) and PE(paired end). Note that if you specify PE in seqtype and your data is fastq, you should give parameter to inputb. If your data is in sam/bed(alignment) format, you don't need to specify inputb.
# [required]outputdirectory: (ABSOLUTE path) Directory for all result. default is current dir "." (if user left it blank)  , but not recommended. 
# [required]outname: Name of all your output results, your results will looks like outname_summary.pdf, outname_profile.txt
# [optional]customregion: (ABSOLUTE path) user defined cutsom region to display nucleosome pattern. 
#                         custom region should be in absolute path, bed format and surfix should be .bed (e.g. /home/user/customregion/XXX.bed)
#                         custom region require a 3 column bed or 6 column bed file, if it contains 6 or more columns, the 6th column should be strand (+/-), in that case CAM will display strand specific signal. (e.g. flip signal for - strand)
#                         limit of custom region is 50k, if the number of custom region is greater than 50k, CAM will take top 50k regions for nucleosome profile
#                         for example, user can input a list of motif sites (e.g. CTCF motifs) to check nuc pattern on certain motifs. 
#                         Left this parameter empty if you don't need this function
#

### Description of parameters in [Step1_Mapping]
# mapping software is bowtie[used if reads file is FASTQ format] , which should be installed in your default PATH, see Manual
# mapping_p: Number of alignment threads to launch alignment software
# [required] genome_fasta: (ABSOLUTE path) whole genome sequence in fasta format or 2bit format, genome_fasta file should be ends with .fa or .2bit and the genome version should be corresponding with -s species
#     this is the only annotation file used in CAM.
# (ABSOLUTE path) mapindex: Mapping index of bowtie, absolute path, 
#     Users can build mapping index in advance, and input mapping index to CAM to avoid generating mapping index step, which is time consuming. 
#     bowtie mapindex should be absolute path of index filename prefix (without trailing .X.ebwt). this parameter will be directly used as the mapping index parameter of bowtie
#     eg: /home/user/bowtie_index/hg19  (then under your folder  /home/user/bowtie_index/  there should be hg19.1.ebwt, hg19.rev.1.ebwt ....  ), 
# [required] species: Species name (genome version). CAM can use build-in annotation files according to the genome version inputted here.
#     Note: CAM ONLY support hg19, hg38, mm9, mm10 as input for species
#     Note: Contact us if you want other species (genome version). (see Manual on webpages for more detail)
# q30filter: Use q30 criteria (Phred quality scores) to filter reads in samfile/bedfile, set this parameter to 1(default) to turn on this option, set 0 to turn off. Default is 0 (turn off)
# trim3end: trim N bp from 3'end of each reads. Users can set e.g. 30bp to trim 30bp from 3'end of each reads. 
#     It takes effect when sequencing reads is too long (e.g. longer than library size). 
#     For longer reads, trim3end parameter can help trim adapter to improve mappability. Default: 0 (trim 0 bp  == turn off). 
#     Note that for sam/bed input this parameter is ignored. 
#     CAM require fastq reads length consistent in same sample.
#     Read_length - trim3nd > 18bp (at least 18bp should left for mapping).
#     IF trim3end = 0 (trun off), length filter is also close.
# [only works for PE data] fragment_length_limit: limit of fragment length. This parameter works for both bowtie mapping (-X, for fastq input) and mappable fragmentlength selection (for sam/bed input)
# rpm: normalize signal in profile bigwig to reads per million (RPM). set 1 to turn on (default) this function and set 0 to turn off

sample_down_reads = 10000000
upstreamtss = 1000 
downstreamtss = 2000
reads_distance_range = 250
customregion_dis = 1000

### Description of parameters in [Step2_QC]
# sample_down_reads: randomly sample down 10M(default) reads to save time for some time consuming QC step, e.g. reads quality, nucleosome relationship, nucleosome length distribution
#     you can change the sample down reads number by motify this parameter.
# upstreamTSS/downstreamTSS: up/down stream distance to TSS for calculating reads TSS profile,[we suggest not to change these two parameters] 
#     by default we suggest 1000bp upstream (left in the aggregate plot) and 2000bp downstream (right in the aggregate plot), the limitation is 500bp up/down stream
# reads_distance_range: for single end data, this parameter represent range of distance from each original reads 5'end to all downstream 3'end, 
#                       for paired end data, this parameter represent range of fragment length, and should be same as "fragment_length_limit" in step1, default is 250bp
# customregion_dis: distance to the center of each custom region to plot nucleosome profile, by default its 1000. [we suggest not to change this parameter]user can modify this parameter but should be between 200 ~ 5000 
#                   Note: this parameter will be ignore if customregion is not specified.

[Step3_nucarray]
window_size = 70
smooth_bandwidth = 30
array_fold = 2
array_length = 600

### Description of parameters in [Step3_nucarray]
# window_size: length(bp) of sliding wiwdow for Gaussian smoothing, 70 (default) means sliding window size is +-70 = 140bp
#     Note: nucarray use wiggle track in 10bp step, so window size can only be 50, 60, 70, ..., 
# smooth_bandwidth: standard deviation(bp) for Gaussian smoothing, default is 30. see more detail in document.
# array_fold: fold change of array position score v.s. background on each array, user can filter arrays by change this cutoff
# array_length: minimum length of detected nucarray. CAM will discard all arrays with shorter length. by default its 600bp.
